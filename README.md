## Summary

**Pokedex** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of Pok√©mon fetched from the Pok√©API, allows users to search for Pok√©mon by name, and dynamically loads more Pok√©mon as the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶ñüëæ**
